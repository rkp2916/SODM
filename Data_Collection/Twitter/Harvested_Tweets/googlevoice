Invites still going out (FIFO, so be patient). Remember that GV is only available in the US. Invites won't work outside the US
Still sending invites, many more today, but the list is long. Thx for your patience
Just launched the ability to change your Google Voice number.  Your old number stays active for 90 days.   Just go to Settings &gt; Phones.
Invites for Google Voice are going out, and our list is huge, so it will take a while to get though them all.  Be patient.  Thanks!
Google Voice on NBC Today Show: http://bit.ly/JB5LA.  Invites to people on reservations list starting to go out today. (Yay!)
Lots of rumors, coverage, etc., about when Google Voice opens again.  Trust me we're cranking away at it 24/7.  Nothing to report yet...
If you get an email to migrate your GrandCentral account to Google Voice you should do it.  More features and better support!
Check out the latest...when you play your voicemail messages in the inbox, the words light up in the transcription like Karaoke.  Cool:)
Phone numbers in your voicemail transcriptions?  Just click on the number to call it (the Quick Call box in the upper left will open)
You can now send SMS notifications of you voice mail messages to all of your cell phones at one (or any subset).  Check "Settings".
Story of GrandCentral & Google Voice at @Somesso Keynote in London.  Yay.  #smo09
Google network slowdown issues did affect some of our Google Voice users, but everyone should be running normally now.
Also, we're dialing cell phones a little longer, so increase the delay before sending to voicemail to 30 secs to avoid bits of GV in cell vm
Recent change...PIN required by default to check messages through phone (can remove via settings&gt;phones&gt;edit&gt;advanced)
Sorry for the lack of tweets lately....Wesley's been busy...I'll take it up for a bit.
@caryme try getting your mobile voicemail to not pick up until 30 seconds...should fix it .  Assuming you have Call Presentation Off.
Tons of SMSes on Google Voice sent to date!  Yay!
Cost to send a SMS msg while in Berlin on my AT&T iphone: 50c per msg.  Cost using the Google Voice website: FREE.  Yay!
We're checking our (408) 72-VOICE invite hotline for funny vmail msgs, and sending out more invites next week to a select few!
Your Google Voice contacts are shared with Gmail and Google Calendar.  Yay! (And auto-synced with your Android phone if you have one)
Sending SMSes from Google Voice website rocks!  Great way to conserve  txt msgs on your mobile plan.
Another way to avoid GVoice leaving bits of the call presentations in your voicemail is to set your VM to not answer until after 25 seconds
If you are getting bits of the Google Voice greeting in your other voicemail accounts, just make your greeting 15 seconds or longer:)
@loxly sure you can download recorded calls!  Just go to the MORE button and select "download"...the mp3 file is saved to your computer!
Big push today.  Nearly all GC users have been sent upgrade invites to Google Voice Preview.  Yay!
@Saintless Yes people are still calling into our invite hotline.  (408) 72-VOICE.  Leave a funny message for an invite :-).
In answer to a few questions, there are NO connection fees on Google Voice
@techcrunch 100 winners will get their GV Invites sent out shortly
We're a bit silent today because we're all working hard on getting lots more upgrades out to existing GC users.  Lots of progress.
Heard in the Apple store today during an iPhone swap: "Thank God for Google Voice, all my SMS messages are online so I won't lose them!"
@musicman2004 We don't have an easy way to change phone numbers right on on Google Voice (It's still early.)  Chose your # carefully.
Lots more upgrade/migration updates going out today to existing GC users.  Making a ton of progress!  Thanks for everyone's patience.
We added a really great spam filter today...let us know if ever hear that your "factory warranty on your car is about to expire" again!
Lots more GC users will get upgrade invites today and throughout this week.  Lots of progress!  (And thanks for everyone's patience!)
(406) rules...what else can it do for you?
@DeskJocky  Existing users who have upgrade can't invite anyone else for the time being.  We are looking how to reopen to everyone soon.
GC users: Read http://bit.ly/11UZ5i for info on how to access your GC vmail if you choose to migrate from GC to Google Voice Preview.
Sending out more Google Voice preview upgrades to existing GC users who haven't gotten them yet this week.  Thanks for waiting!
@voyagerfan5761 We split your SMS texts over several messages if over 160 characters (so we didn't think a counter was needed)
@Navarr  We've had a facebook page since the launch.  Feel free to join.  (But we're not giving invites there yet)  http://bit.ly/12jjrC

@jayhawkbabe We're still working on upgrading existing GC users right now.  We're giving away a few to folks that call into (408) 72-VOICE.
@apps4life We're still sending out upgrades to our existing GC users this weekend and likely early next week as well.  Thanks for waiting!
@webjamdotorg Yes you can save the 406 numbers. You can keep on sms-ing them and calling as long as you do it from your registered phones.
@boxkite We sent out some invites to those that left very funny messages. (We only had a few).  We'll have some more to give away next week.
@chillgil We aren't open yet to non-GC users yet, but you can call into our invite hotline at (408) 72-VOICE to request one.
From a friend:  I made $1.46 worth of calls and talked for 73 min.  [My cell carrier] probably would have charged me that much for 1 min.
@jonmelzer  Updates are still being sent out to existing GC users this weekend and probably early next week.  Thanks for your patience!
GC Users:  Upgrades to voice are still going out, thanks for you patience.  We want to get everyone  moved quickly over.  Thanks.

@Navarr  You can submit bug reports here: http://bit.ly/D4rbK
@justinstevens Yes, you can use SkypeIn phone number as a forwarding phone number.  We've tested it and it works!
@webdav We've gotten several hundred vmail msgs so far.  You can call in again and leave another msg if you want.  Team loves the songs!
@darnell Yes we support low-cost int'l calling.  You can call your own GC number and dial that number.  Rates here: http://bit.ly/pOSLX
Reply to a couple of ?s: Note that fwding to canadian phones is not free.  We only support free domestic US fwding.  Cost is $0.01 per min.
@gsharma This is due to the linking to Gmail contacts.  You probably have another contact there from gmail w/ same email addr.
Canadian GC users:  you should be able to migrate after you get your invite. We removed the limitation on migration for users  there.
@veddebra  Love is coming soon!  Hopefully today.  Thanks for your patience, we are working hard on getting GC users updated today.
We started sending out a few invites to some of the awesome voicemail msgs people left on (408) 72-VOICE.  Yay!
@Navarr We can confirm that SMS shortcodes aren't supported on Google Voice right now.  (So send those directly from your mobile phone)
@boxkite We got your funny  song!  Thank you for leaving it!  (We're still going thru the rest of the messages)
There's still time to call and leave a funny voicemail msg to request an invite.  (408) 72-VOICE.  We esp. like the limericks & songs.
@802dotchris We're working today to get the remaining invites out to GC users that haven't gotten their upgrades to Google Voice yet.
@earldriscoll Yes custom voicemail greetings in Google Voice let you leave a different greeting for Joe & Marty.
So many of you left awesome voicemails on (408) 72-VOICE.  We especially love that some of you sang funny songs for us.  (Hint hint :-)
@ChrisLAS Thanks for the video review!  Re: privacy, see @pogue comments about your carrier :-)
@torgorama  Yes you can record a different, custom voicemail greetings for each of your screened callers.  It's fun!
Wow over 60 voicemails! on (408) 72-VOICE!  Keep them coming!, we'll be sending out invites to the funniest msgs tomorrow.

Quick survey...what's the single best feature of Google Voice?  One number for many phones?  Transcription?  Screening?  SMS? SPAM control?
@pogue on Google Voice mobile apps:  http://bit.ly/QHPF0
Tons of invites still going out.  List is still quite long.  First come, first served.  You should get yours in the near future.

Invites still going out (FIFO, so be patient). Remember that GV is only available in the US. Invites won't work outside the US
Still sending invites, many more today, but the list is long. Thx for your patience
Just launched the ability to change your Google Voice number.  Your old number stays active for 90 days.   Just go to Settings &gt; Phones.
Invites for Google Voice are going out, and our list is huge, so it will take a while to get though them all.  Be patient.  Thanks!
Google Voice on NBC Today Show: http://bit.ly/JB5LA.  Invites to people on reservations list starting to go out today. (Yay!)
Lots of rumors, coverage, etc., about when Google Voice opens again.  Trust me we're cranking away at it 24/7.  Nothing to report yet...
If you get an email to migrate your GrandCentral account to Google Voice you should do it.  More features and better support!
Check out the latest...when you play your voicemail messages in the inbox, the words light up in the transcription like Karaoke.  Cool:)
Phone numbers in your voicemail transcriptions?  Just click on the number to call it (the Quick Call box in the upper left will open)
You can now send SMS notifications of you voice mail messages to all of your cell phones at one (or any subset).  Check "Settings".
Story of GrandCentral & Google Voice at @Somesso Keynote in London.  Yay.  #smo09
Google network slowdown issues did affect some of our Google Voice users, but everyone should be running normally now.
Also, we're dialing cell phones a little longer, so increase the delay before sending to voicemail to 30 secs to avoid bits of GV in cell vm
Recent change...PIN required by default to check messages through phone (can remove via settings&gt;phones&gt;edit&gt;advanced)
Sorry for the lack of tweets lately....Wesley's been busy...I'll take it up for a bit.
@caryme try getting your mobile voicemail to not pick up until 30 seconds...should fix it .  Assuming you have Call Presentation Off.
Tons of SMSes on Google Voice sent to date!  Yay!
Cost to send a SMS msg while in Berlin on my AT&T iphone: 50c per msg.  Cost using the Google Voice website: FREE.  Yay!
We're checking our (408) 72-VOICE invite hotline for funny vmail msgs, and sending out more invites next week to a select few!
Your Google Voice contacts are shared with Gmail and Google Calendar.  Yay! (And auto-synced with your Android phone if you have one)
Sending SMSes from Google Voice website rocks!  Great way to conserve  txt msgs on your mobile plan.
Another way to avoid GVoice leaving bits of the call presentations in your voicemail is to set your VM to not answer until after 25 seconds
If you are getting bits of the Google Voice greeting in your other voicemail accounts, just make your greeting 15 seconds or longer:)
@loxly sure you can download recorded calls!  Just go to the MORE button and select "download"...the mp3 file is saved to your computer!

@techcrunch 100 winners will get their GV Invites sent out shortly
We're a bit silent today because we're all working hard on getting lots more upgrades out to existing GC users.  Lots of progress.
Heard in the Apple store today during an iPhone swap: "Thank God for Google Voice, all my SMS messages are online so I won't lose them!"
@musicman2004 We don't have an easy way to change phone numbers right on on Google Voice (It's still early.)  Chose your # carefully.
Lots more upgrade/migration updates going out today to existing GC users.  Making a ton of progress!  Thanks for everyone's patience.
We added a really great spam filter today...let us know if ever hear that your "factory warranty on your car is about to expire" again!
Lots more GC users will get upgrade invites today and throughout this week.  Lots of progress!  (And thanks for everyone's patience!)
(406) rules...what else can it do for you?
@DeskJocky  Existing users who have upgrade can't invite anyone else for the time being.  We are looking how to reopen to everyone soon.
GC users: Read http://bit.ly/11UZ5i for info on how to access your GC vmail if you choose to migrate from GC to Google Voice Preview.

@chillgil We aren't open yet to non-GC users yet, but you can call into our invite hotline at (408) 72-VOICE to request one.
From a friend:  I made $1.46 worth of calls and talked for 73 min.  [My cell carrier] probably would have charged me that much for 1 min.
@jonmelzer  Updates are still being sent out to existing GC users this weekend and probably early next week.  Thanks for your patience!
GC Users:  Upgrades to voice are still going out, thanks for you patience.  We want to get everyone  moved quickly over.  Thanks.

Reply to a couple of ?s: Note that fwding to canadian phones is not free.  We only support free domestic US fwding.  Cost is $0.01 per min.
@gsharma This is due to the linking to Gmail contacts.  You probably have another contact there from gmail w/ same email addr.
Canadian GC users:  you should be able to migrate after you get your invite. We removed the limitation on migration for users  there.
@veddebra  Love is coming soon!  Hopefully today.  Thanks for your patience, we are working hard on getting GC users updated today.
We started sending out a few invites to some of the awesome voicemail msgs people left on (408) 72-VOICE.  Yay!
@Navarr We can confirm that SMS shortcodes aren't supported on Google Voice right now.  (So send those directly from your mobile phone)
@boxkite We got your funny  song!  Thank you for leaving it!  (We're still going thru the rest of the messages)
There's still time to call and leave a funny voicemail msg to request an invite.  (408) 72-VOICE.  We esp. like the limericks & songs.
@802dotchris We're working today to get the remaining invites out to GC users that haven't gotten their upgrades to Google Voice yet.
@earldriscoll Yes custom voicemail greetings in Google Voice let you leave a different greeting for Joe & Marty.
So many of you left awesome voicemails on (408) 72-VOICE.  We especially love that some of you sang funny songs for us.  (Hint hint :-)
