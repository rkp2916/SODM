@vijay750 GDP &amp; health are generally positively correlated. Kerala is an example where both are relatively high.
@_manu_j Good point. That's a possible reason.
@_manu_j True -- maybe most people in Haryana are poor with few super-rich. But health ind are a mean too. Need to see raw data :-)
Despite excellent GDP per capita, Haryana has really poor health indicators. Wonder why.

Tempted to tell Mike Bostock: stop committing so much! I get a MASSIVE inferiority complex :-) ... but thanks for all the code!
@anusharma When you say avg, I presume you mean "mean"? Yes, this is true for most people in a power-law network like Facebook
@vemana Yeah -- it's on appengine, and ran out of the daily quota. Will get back up in 4 hours.
Will be continuing my talk on Automated Data Analysis at #pyconindia2012 tomorrow at 11am.
Total #pyconindia2012 tweets so far: 232. As I said, there're more small data than big data problems.
@_manu_j @gkjohn I'm advocating median for continuous data as well. Will blog about it.

How a victimised tweeter met his troll face-to-face. Wow! http://t.co/7KJ6R6Sn
http://t.co/ntawNJ2t has a great tip on how to read other people's code: start with the first commit.
@actgggcatgcatgc @anusharma That's the thing. If it's Gaussian, mean=median. Else, median's more robust. Seems median is pareto optimal :-)
@anusharma Will blog about it this week.
@anusharma Yes. After much R&amp;D, I conclude that you'd ALWAYS use median not mean for DISCRETE data (not continuous, like physics)

@govindk True! Most of my travel is to Tamil Nadu, though... the roads are pretty decent.
@Vizz_B Will bring it when I come over.
@gonsalves_r True. Most of my bus travel is to Tamil Nadu, though, and the roads there are rather good -- thankfully!
@aadvaark Interesting you say that. I've done more reading in buses. But then, I do have to increase the font size 2x
@Vizz_B No, Coimbatore. Will be at Chennai mid-Oct.

Know any JS libraries that let you draw arrows and annotate / mark up a web page?
@tutysara Yes, been reading up a few papers on that, plus on binning algorithms. Hope it finds its way into numpy.
@jackerhack @zainabbawa Oh, didn't know. Thanks! @_ketann @anandology @hasgeek @pyconindia
@_ketann Sorry, meant should be live shortly. @hasgeek @pyconindia
@_ketann Yes, thanks to @hasgeek - should be shortly @pyconindia
@tutysara I can't think of a way of finding the median without sorting, unfortunately...
But calculating the median O(n log n) is SO MUCH SLOWER than the mean O(n). https://t.co/MrEmPacM
@gonsalves_r @thej @fakenisha There was a project presentation at my NIAS class this morning on this exact topic!
@vijay750 GDP &amp; health are generally positively correlated. Kerala is an example where both are relatively high.
@_manu_j Good point. That's a possible reason.
@_manu_j True -- maybe most people in Haryana are poor with few super-rich. But health ind are a mean too. Need to see raw data :-)
Despite excellent GDP per capita, Haryana has really poor health indicators. Wonder why.

@karthiks Any chance of blogging about it? @anusharma
Tempted to tell Mike Bostock: stop committing so much! I get a MASSIVE inferiority complex :-) ... but thanks for all the code!
@anusharma When you say avg, I presume you mean "mean"? Yes, this is true for most people in a power-law network like Facebook
@vemana Yeah -- it's on appengine, and ran out of the daily quota. Will get back up in 4 hours.
Will be continuing my talk on Automated Data Analysis at #pyconindia2012 tomorrow at 11am.
Total #pyconindia2012 tweets so far: 232. As I said, there're more small data than big data problems.
@_manu_j @gkjohn I'm advocating median for continuous data as well. Will blog about it.
iOS6 supports Symbol - the 8th font that's common with Windows. Welcome addition for my old presentations.

@nixxin Am only at Delhi that one day, but no worries, will be there some other time I am sure. Thanks!
How a victimised tweeter met his troll face-to-face. Wow! http://t.co/7KJ6R6Sn
http://t.co/ntawNJ2t has a great tip on how to read other people's code: start with the first commit.
@actgggcatgcatgc @anusharma That's the thing. If it's Gaussian, mean=median. Else, median's more robust. Seems median is pareto optimal :-)
@anusharma Will blog about it this week.
@anusharma Yes. After much R&amp;D, I conclude that you'd ALWAYS use median not mean for DISCRETE data (not continuous, like physics)
@nixxin Am at Delhi this Friday. Could we meet to talk about data journalism? More about me at http://t.co/YvDYOq1g &amp; http://t.co/XBzeiLqu

@govindk True! Most of my travel is to Tamil Nadu, though... the roads are pretty decent.
@Vizz_B Will bring it when I come over.
@gonsalves_r True. Most of my bus travel is to Tamil Nadu, though, and the roads there are rather good -- thankfully!
@aadvaark Interesting you say that. I've done more reading in buses. But then, I do have to increase the font size 2x
@Vizz_B No, Coimbatore. Will be at Chennai mid-Oct.

@jaidevd Yup, see you at #the5el
@bargava Not planned yet. NIAS has a bunch of data, so does NCBS. Plan to vote on those :-)
