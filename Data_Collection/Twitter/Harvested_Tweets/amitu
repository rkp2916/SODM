@nirbheek lucky you. In my building airtel is not am option and the local provider sucks. Suppose Banglore would be better than Bombay.
@newchaos desktop is totally different, much better story tho. But all my reading happens on phone.
@newchaos so my twitter stream would start from start. Taught me quickly to never open Evernote unless you want to lose the scroll position.
@newchaos hmm. I ll give ever note another try. But last I tried switching from current app to Evernote on iphone4 force closed the app.
@newchaos see. How easy this is. Try capture a conversation of twitter in Evernote. http://t.co/2mDDmmnTT4
@newchaos yes. Or keep some kid of index. With my paper notebooks I keep index for what I write there.
@newchaos but this is the state of affairs today. Good you are happy. I am not.
@newchaos same for iBook, sure they have highlighting and god only knows where those highlights go. I just screencap it and it's everywhere.
@newchaos yeah but if there are 200 comments in a thread and you want to keep one?
@newchaos especially if primary mode of accessing Facebook is thru mobile app.
@newchaos tell me even one method to store Facebook comment other than screenshot.
@nirbheek the problem is you talking abt it. I mean if you could have just shifted, you would have, but you did not, so they must increase.
@newchaos doesn't matter. Not lost. With paper etc they are utterly lost.
@newchaos screenshot is the exclusive way to bookmark Facebook/reddit/hackernews comment gems for example.
@newchaos you know what works for me? Screen shots! I read something, Cmd-Shift-4. It goes to Dropbox. Same works in iPhone.
@newchaos hmm. I won't doubt. But I would not say internet is all good. People are reading far more, but retaining far less.
@newchaos I am talking abt last 4
Months. Anything I read off line I have. Anything (&gt;90%) I read online is lost.
@newchaos but one thing for sure. If you care abt learning. Do not subscribe online. Get magazines. Online reading is utter waste of time.
@newchaos sure. I am not saying it hasn't. I am talking about one particular aspect only.
@newchaos how do I tell you. It's like default keep or magazines and default forget for internet. Magazines don't evaporate. Internet does.
@newchaos I have electronics 4 you, four months only. Everytime I anything from there I locate it in mins. Anything internet, hopeless.
@newchaos plus there are people like me who want to use, but can't do anything but blame themselves coz they can't use the tools
@newchaos no. Sure. Most people don't. But if you find the percentages those who did few decades far out number those who do today.
@newchaos it's like saying pollution is not a problem because electric cars exist.
@newchaos I am talking abt internet era is pushing people back. Existence of tool has no meaning unless people are using it.
@newchaos and they are really good at locating info. I needed some articles abt Gujarat from 2002, and I travelled.
@newchaos my dad can locate everything he still reads. My grandfather has most than 10 years of newspaper and mags.
@newchaos because that's what happened till a few decades back.
@newchaos and how many are putting everything on reading list that they ever read?
@newchaos it's not I did not try it. I tried hard. 5000+ delicious links. Loads in instapaper and pocket. Many on Dropbox/PDF, bookmarks.
@newchaos and even if you are the geekiest of geek, best tool, etc, you forgot to click that bookmark button and it's lost.
@newchaos add all that. I don't think it comes to 1% of internet uses who have even an account on them.
@newchaos we don't know what we ll need in future. Stack of magazine I can go back to. Internet is lost cause.
@newchaos but divide 75 million by one billion. How many of 75 million use it to bookmark everything they ll need in future?
@newchaos a good article on heart pressure that I read but not needed that day coz I don't have BP, tomorrow I can't refer to a friend.
@newchaos sure today we are reading much more. But reading once is useless, anything worth reading must be read many times to get most of it
@newchaos few decades back, 90% population could locate everything they read last month. Today less than 0.001%. Regression.
@newchaos I get your point. I may not have desciline but how many internet users are doing it better than me? Zero (percentage wise).
@newchaos My twitter app does not have the tool bar you are talking abt. Ctrl P is also not an option. I am just saying nobody is doing it.
@newchaos everything I read in last week is an impossible query in this Information Age. Which was trivial in paper age. This is regression.
@newchaos I use hacker news app, and twitter app and Facebook app for majority of my reading. No search, no browser history.
@newchaos if I would have just done a ctrl-p to everything I would have had a much better time locating what I read.
@newchaos Again. I read some article. Was it Facebook, or twitter, or hacker news? I read like 20-30 articles a day. All lost.
@newchaos there is nothing tangible. I can't use spatial memory to locate information that I do with books and magezines.
@newchaos again. I am not talking link rot. It's a problem but small. Imagine if you did not bookmark at all. Google won't help in that case
@newchaos compare that to old fashioned books, which one can go again and again to entire life, keep refreshing, finding new meanings etc.
@newchaos its like we are starting today. But we are not. I been using internet since 16 years now. All lost. Just some vague rememberences.
@newchaos again I understand the theory, but paper just came. How abt before that. How abt delicious, you must have used it. All lost. No?
@newchaos I understand. But tools require a level of desciline I seem to not have.
@newchaos I have used all three of them. And delicious. And browser bookmark. You can say I am doing it wrong. But is anyone doing right?
@newchaos I don't bookmark. The vague recollection I have abt title or keywords never lead to original article on google. It basically lost.
@newchaos like so much I read but then I have to locate it some time after wards to a friend and I can't find it.
@newchaos problem is not just link rot. It's problem of recall. I know some article I read a month back, but it's almost never recallable.

Only reason Modi is contender is because Adnani etc gave him loads of black money, which he poured into APCO etc PR agencies/Media.
And outside of development, Modi is just a mass-murderer, wife abondener, lier, communal, who is only out of jail as long as he is in govt.
And Gujarat developed at same rate with Modi as before him. Modi, played no role, and is simply stealing credit from hardworking Gujaratis.
Saying Gujarat is most developed state in India is pure and utter lie. Karnataka/Maharashtra etc all equal or ahead. Modi is selling a lie.

@newchaos sure. Most don't. But can't say nobody does. Include stock exchanges. Mutual banks. Your explanation is too "convenient".
@newchaos of course my theory has major problem in explaining why *no* bank was exploited, NSA won't warn Punjab National Bank for example.
@newchaos assumption: NSA knew abt it and warned banks abt it, is not at all far fetched. NSA played role in creating them is bit too much.

@nirbheek lucky you. In my building airtel is not am option and the local provider sucks. Suppose Banglore would be better than Bombay.
@newchaos desktop is totally different, much better story tho. But all my reading happens on phone.
@newchaos so my twitter stream would start from start. Taught me quickly to never open Evernote unless you want to lose the scroll position.
@newchaos hmm. I ll give ever note another try. But last I tried switching from current app to Evernote on iphone4 force closed the app.
@newchaos see. How easy this is. Try capture a conversation of twitter in Evernote. http://t.co/2mDDmmnTT4
@newchaos yes. Or keep some kid of index. With my paper notebooks I keep index for what I write there.
@newchaos but this is the state of affairs today. Good you are happy. I am not.
@newchaos same for iBook, sure they have highlighting and god only knows where those highlights go. I just screencap it and it's everywhere.
@newchaos yeah but if there are 200 comments in a thread and you want to keep one?
@newchaos especially if primary mode of accessing Facebook is thru mobile app.
@newchaos tell me even one method to store Facebook comment other than screenshot.
@nirbheek the problem is you talking abt it. I mean if you could have just shifted, you would have, but you did not, so they must increase.
@newchaos doesn't matter. Not lost. With paper etc they are utterly lost.
@newchaos screenshot is the exclusive way to bookmark Facebook/reddit/hackernews comment gems for example.
@newchaos you know what works for me? Screen shots! I read something, Cmd-Shift-4. It goes to Dropbox. Same works in iPhone.
@newchaos hmm. I won't doubt. But I would not say internet is all good. People are reading far more, but retaining far less.
@newchaos I am talking abt last 4
Months. Anything I read off line I have. Anything (&gt;90%) I read online is lost.
@newchaos but one thing for sure. If you care abt learning. Do not subscribe online. Get magazines. Online reading is utter waste of time.
@newchaos sure. I am not saying it hasn't. I am talking about one particular aspect only.
@newchaos how do I tell you. It's like default keep or magazines and default forget for internet. Magazines don't evaporate. Internet does.
@newchaos I have electronics 4 you, four months only. Everytime I anything from there I locate it in mins. Anything internet, hopeless.
@newchaos plus there are people like me who want to use, but can't do anything but blame themselves coz they can't use the tools
@newchaos no. Sure. Most people don't. But if you find the percentages those who did few decades far out number those who do today.
@newchaos it's like saying pollution is not a problem because electric cars exist.
@newchaos I am talking abt internet era is pushing people back. Existence of tool has no meaning unless people are using it.
@newchaos and they are really good at locating info. I needed some articles abt Gujarat from 2002, and I travelled.
@newchaos my dad can locate everything he still reads. My grandfather has most than 10 years of newspaper and mags.
@newchaos because that's what happened till a few decades back.
@newchaos and how many are putting everything on reading list that they ever read?
@newchaos it's not I did not try it. I tried hard. 5000+ delicious links. Loads in instapaper and pocket. Many on Dropbox/PDF, bookmarks.
@newchaos and even if you are the geekiest of geek, best tool, etc, you forgot to click that bookmark button and it's lost.
@newchaos add all that. I don't think it comes to 1% of internet uses who have even an account on them.
@newchaos we don't know what we ll need in future. Stack of magazine I can go back to. Internet is lost cause.
@newchaos but divide 75 million by one billion. How many of 75 million use it to bookmark everything they ll need in future?
@newchaos a good article on heart pressure that I read but not needed that day coz I don't have BP, tomorrow I can't refer to a friend.
@newchaos sure today we are reading much more. But reading once is useless, anything worth reading must be read many times to get most of it
@newchaos few decades back, 90% population could locate everything they read last month. Today less than 0.001%. Regression.
@newchaos I get your point. I may not have desciline but how many internet users are doing it better than me? Zero (percentage wise).
@newchaos My twitter app does not have the tool bar you are talking abt. Ctrl P is also not an option. I am just saying nobody is doing it.
@newchaos everything I read in last week is an impossible query in this Information Age. Which was trivial in paper age. This is regression.
@newchaos I use hacker news app, and twitter app and Facebook app for majority of my reading. No search, no browser history.
@newchaos if I would have just done a ctrl-p to everything I would have had a much better time locating what I read.
@newchaos Again. I read some article. Was it Facebook, or twitter, or hacker news? I read like 20-30 articles a day. All lost.
@newchaos there is nothing tangible. I can't use spatial memory to locate information that I do with books and magezines.
@newchaos again. I am not talking link rot. It's a problem but small. Imagine if you did not bookmark at all. Google won't help in that case
@newchaos compare that to old fashioned books, which one can go again and again to entire life, keep refreshing, finding new meanings etc.
@newchaos its like we are starting today. But we are not. I been using internet since 16 years now. All lost. Just some vague rememberences.
@newchaos again I understand the theory, but paper just came. How abt before that. How abt delicious, you must have used it. All lost. No?
@newchaos I understand. But tools require a level of desciline I seem to not have.
@newchaos I have used all three of them. And delicious. And browser bookmark. You can say I am doing it wrong. But is anyone doing right?
@newchaos I don't bookmark. The vague recollection I have abt title or keywords never lead to original article on google. It basically lost.
@newchaos like so much I read but then I have to locate it some time after wards to a friend and I can't find it.
@newchaos problem is not just link rot. It's problem of recall. I know some article I read a month back, but it's almost never recallable.

Only reason Modi is contender is because Adnani etc gave him loads of black money, which he poured into APCO etc PR agencies/Media.
And outside of development, Modi is just a mass-murderer, wife abondener, lier, communal, who is only out of jail as long as he is in govt.
And Gujarat developed at same rate with Modi as before him. Modi, played no role, and is simply stealing credit from hardworking Gujaratis.
Saying Gujarat is most developed state in India is pure and utter lie. Karnataka/Maharashtra etc all equal or ahead. Modi is selling a lie.
OK, revising my tweet, it proves at least in one sector, IT(largest employing sector btw), Gujarat fucked up while other states raced ahead.

@newchaos sure. Most don't. But can't say nobody does. Include stock exchanges. Mutual banks. Your explanation is too "convenient".
@newchaos of course my theory has major problem in explaining why *no* bank was exploited, NSA won't warn Punjab National Bank for example.
@newchaos assumption: NSA knew abt it and warned banks abt it, is not at all far fetched. NSA played role in creating them is bit too much.
@newchaos I know I know, the surest way to prove anything wrong is call it conspiracy theory.
@newchaos what is conspiratorial is that there is no major attack despite such major holes, it's as if banks etc got advance warnings.
